# Weatherly

Launch App: <a href="https://gs-jm-weatherly.herokuapp.com/">Weatherly</a>

#### By Gray Smith and Jesse McFadden

Weatherly is a dynamic real-time weather app built in React. Data for this app is pulled from the WeatherUnderground API and the background photo matches the weather. Search autocomplete is implemented with a custom Binary Search Trie and user preferences are saved to local storage. The design for this app was made in Figma.

### User Interaction

Upon input of the desired forecast location, users are presented with the current weather for that location along with the next 7 hours consisting of the condition, and projected temperature. After a user toggles the 10 day forecast, they see the condition along with the projected high and low temperatures.

### Design Process

We mocked up the layout using Figma, a component based, in-browser, design tool. It was great to be able to think through the design before writing the code. This helped us get on the same page quickly and begin working with the same designs in mind.

### Design Inspiration

Our design intent was based off the Yahoo weather application. We appreciated the simplicity and clean design of the Yahoo weather app. We were inspired by the stark contrast between large and small text.

This design from dribbble also inspired us with the way that the text popped off the background.
