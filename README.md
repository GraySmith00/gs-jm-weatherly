# Weatherly


#### By Gray Smith and Jesse McFadden

Weatherly is a dynamic, front-end react application that uses real-time weather data to present the current, 7 hour, and 10 day weather forecasts. It was built using create-react-app.

### User Interaction 

Upon input of the desired forecast location, users are presented with the current weather for that location along with the next 7 hours consisting of the condition, and projected temperature. After a user toggles the 10 day forecast, they see the condition along with the projected high and low temperatures.

### Design    

We mocked up the layout using Figma, our component based, in-browser, design tool. This is the first time we've used a design tool. It was great to be able to think through the design before writing the code. This helped us get on the same page quickly and begin working with the same designs in mind.

### Figma Design Intent

Our design intent was based off the Yahoo weather application. We appreciated the simplicity and clean design of the Yahoo weather app. We were inspired by the stark contrast between large and small text.

This design from dribbble also inspired us with the way that the text popped off the background.
